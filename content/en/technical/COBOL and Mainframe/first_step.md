"A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step." This quote strongly resonates with me since I started this new and exciting chapter in my career: a COBOL developer at an Israeli bank.

Transitioning to the world of mainframe and COBOL feels like jumping to another branch, perhaps even another continent, on the evolutionary tree of technology. Everything feels different, complex, and requires a deep shift in perspective. It feels like an ancient tree, but one with deep roots that continue to sustain critical systems to this day. There's so much to learn, and every day reveals new layers of knowledge to me.

This blog is my way of documenting this journey, my challenges, insights, and achievements. I hope that through writing here, I'll meet fellow travelers, both seasoned and new developers, who can broaden my perspective on the world of COBOL and mainframe beyond the specific bubble of my workplace.

## Between Questions and a New Horizon
Currently, I'm primarily full of questions. Here are some of the ones that are particularly on my mind:

- **z/OS Best Practices**: What are the best practices for working in a z/OS environment? How can I organize and manage information and files in an orderly and efficient manner, while maintaining optimal performance?

- **Streamlining Workflows**: How can I perform the necessary tasks within my work, from development to debugging, in the fastest and most accurate way?

- **Mastering ISPF Tools**: I aim to gain in-depth knowledge of the various tools available in ISPF and understand how to leverage them maximally for development.
Understanding the File System: How does the mainframe file system work? What are the nuances in information management, and how can I navigate it efficiently?

- **Utilizing Debugging Tools**: We work with XPEDITER for code debugging, and I want to understand how to use its full potential to quickly identify and resolve issues.

- **Learning LOG-ON's DTP**: I'm interested in learning about DTP (Data Transformation Platform) from LOG-ON, particularly its capabilities in standardizing, centralizing, and maintaining reference data in memory for performance improvements. I'd love to understand this software in depth and its significance for us.

- **Investigating Batch and CICS Processes**: How can I independently research and better understand the processes that occur in Batch and CICS environments, and their interactions?

I admit I feel like I'm at a stage where I barely know what to ask, but my passion to learn and explore is strong. I'm actively seeking high-quality information sources: blogs, books, videos, and of course, connections with professionals who can light my way.

So, if you know this world, or are on a similar journey, I'd love to hear from you! How do you deal with that "lost" feeling in the initial stages? Join me on this fascinating journey into the depths of the mainframe.
