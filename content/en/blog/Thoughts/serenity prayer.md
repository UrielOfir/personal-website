    The serenity prayer as a guide through life's chaos, underscoring acceptance, courage, and wisdom.

"God, grant me serenity to accept what I cannot change,  
courage to change what I can,   
And the wisdom to distinguish between the two."  

This prayer, in my view, embodies the quintessential philosophy for navigating life's challenges.  
We often wish life could be as straightforward as a video game,
where everything is precisely tailored to our capabilities, allowing us to advance and succeed step by step.  

Yet, life is inherently chaotic.  

It's filled with sufferings we are powerless to alter.  
We encounter obstacles that, despite our best efforts, lead to failure.  
The moments I hold in high regard are those when I've either reconciled with grief,  
Or when I've risen to a challenge, effecting change until achieving the sought-after outcome.


And then there's life, replete with trials I've attempted to surmount and failed, along with sorrows I took too long to reconcile with.

Life perpetually introduces us to the unfamiliar,
which invariably falls outside the neat frameworks we've constructed in our minds.

And for a moment in this odyssey, I express my gratitude.  
(Thus, I conclude this piece with yet another platitude...)
