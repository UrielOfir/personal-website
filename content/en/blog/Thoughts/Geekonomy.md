In the midst of the national chaos, it was quite challenging to find a moment to acknowledge that the episode featuring Shlomi Eldar marks the remarkable 800th installment of the Geekonomy podcast!
I decided to take a brief pause and jot down my thoughts about this extraordinary podcast, which happens to be my absolute favorite. It has been a constant companion throughout many years.

Let me begin by emphasizing the profound impact this podcast has had on my perspective of the world. When I first started tuning in, I was a curious student at the Har Hamor Beit Midrash, which, for those unfamiliar, was instrumental in the creation of the Noam party.

I distinctly remember Doron Nir discussing the concept of 'geekiness' and highlighting that even a seemingly mundane topic could be explored with such precision and craftsmanship that it becomes impossible to overlook its quality. It dawned on me that the world can be seen from countless angles, and it isn't what I initially perceived.

I was fortunate enough to be featured on the podcast, an achievement I'm deeply proud of, although I must admit I was less satisfied with the final result of the episode. It's worth noting that Reem Sherman has since improved her ability to interview individuals with religious perspectives and grant them the space to express their worldviews.

In these trying times, I find solace in the fact that the podcast continues to produce high-quality content that I thoroughly enjoy. There are so many episodes that have opened my mind to new ideas and experiences, but I'll limit my mention to the exceptional episode featuring Shushan Hearn, the leader of the Fair Planet association. Their mission to combat world hunger by collaborating with small farmers in impoverished nations left a lasting impression on me. It's even more poignant to me now, knowing that she is currently held in captivity in Gaza, given the personal connection I developed through that particular episode.

I also invite you to share your favorite episodes in the comments as we celebrate this momentous 800th episode!
