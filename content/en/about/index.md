**2013-2014**   
After dedicating many years to the study of Gemara and Rabbi Kook's teachings,   
and with encouragement of  Rabbi David Giami,   
a prominent figure at Har Hamor Yeshiva,   
I started some research. 

My goal was to explore how graduates of the beit midrash,   
upon transitioning to civilian life,   
could keep that spiritual spark alive.

Turns out, my study led me to realize the traditional Jewish-Orthodox approach had some fundamental flaws.

**2018**   
My life was abruptly shaken by the sudden passing of my brother.  
I was pretty heartbroken and decided to hit pause on my studies,   
uncertain if I would ever be able to resume them.   
Instead, I returned to live with my parents in Nir Galim.

(I captured this photo of the sea during the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva_(Judaism)">Shiva</a> for my brother.)
