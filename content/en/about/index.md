**2013-2014**   
After dedicating many years to the study of Gemara and Rabbi Kook's teachings,   
and with encouragement of  Rabbi David Giami,   
a prominent figure at Har Hamor Yeshiva,   
I embarked on a research journey. 

My goal was to explore how graduates of the beit midrash,   
upon transitioning to civilian life,   
could maintain the same spiritual essence they had cultivated in their studies.

The culmination of my study led me to the realization that   
the Jewish-Orthodox approach was fundamentally flawed.

Instead, I returned to live with my parents in Nir Galim.
