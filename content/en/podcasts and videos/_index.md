I'm excited to share some of the cool podcasts and videos I've been up to.

First, I've got my very own podcast called ["Where Did You Go?"](./where_did_you_go). In this podcast, I mainly interview graduates of religious education in Israel. It's a fun hobby of mine where we dive into their experiences and insights.

But that's not all! I've also had the chance to be a guest on other podcasts. In those conversations, I've shared my life journey, talked about my thoughts on faith, and more.

And if you're into videos, I've got you covered. You'll find various engaging videos, mainly lectures, where I'm a part of the discussion. Feel free to explore and learn more about my experiences and ideas. Enjoy your visit!
